msg00:00:sno:Any chance I could turn<BR>this into some money?
//"Any chance this might turn into some money?"
//M2 is a young, married man- early-late 20s, I'd say. 
msg00:00:sno:When she died, my<BR>grandmother told me to<BR>sell this off if I ever<C>got into trouble. Well...
//"My grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got in trouble before she died."
msg00:00:sno:This is something my<BR>grandmother treasured...<BR>but, well...
//"This is something my grandmother always treasured..."
msg00:00:sno:I'd like you to buy this,<BR>but... well, I want a good<BR>price, you know?
//"I'd like you to buy this, but..."
msg00:03:sno:You interested in buying<BR>this?
///"So, this- any way it could turn into money?"
msg00:03:sno:A tight balance sheet this<BR>month... this is precious,<BR>but I think I can sell it.
//"I spent a little too much this month. This is kind of precious but I figure I can do without it."
msg00:03:sno:I think this might sell...<BR>how much?
//"This is about all I've got that looks like it might sell."
msg00:01:sno:Hi, I came by to sell this<BR>today.
//"I came to sell this today."

msg01:01:sno:Hi! How much for this?
//"Any chance you could sell this to me?"
msg01:01:sno:Could I get this, please?
//"I'd like you to sell this."
msg01:04:sno:Ah, I was looking for this!
//"Ah, I was looking for this!"
msg01:04:sno:Haha, never thought I'd<BR>find one of these here!
//"I never thought I'd find this here."
msg01:04:sno:You have one of these?<BR>It's a lucky day for both<BR>of us, then!
//"You've got this? Lucky!"
msg01:01:sno:This is for sale, right?
//"Is that thing there for sale?"
msg01:00:sno:The wife asked me to pick<BR>this up.
//"I was asked to go buy this..."

msg02:01:sno:Yeah, that'll do. How much?
//"Ah, that! How much is it?"
msg02:00:sno:That? Huh, it'll do.
//"That, huh... Well, it'll do."
msg02:04:sno:Perfect! How much?
//"Yeah, that, that!"
msg02:04:sno:That's it! How much?
//That's it!"

msg03:03:sno:You can't buy it for a<BR>bit more?
//"I'd like you to buy it for a bit more."
msg03:00:sno:That's too cheap! Can't<BR>you make the offer a<BR>bit better?
//"That's too cheap! Make it a bit better."
msg03:03:sno:Is it that cheap? Come on,<BR>gimme a better offer.
//"Is it THAT cheap? Come on, give me another offer."
msg03:03:sno:That's way too little. I<BR>know you can give me more<BR>than that...
//"That's way too cheap. Come on, can't you make it a bit better?"
msg03:03:sno:Is it... really worth so<BR>little?...
//"Is this worth that little? Can't you give me a bit more money?"
msg03:03:sno:That's a problem... I can't<BR>balance the budget on<BR>that.
//"That's a problem... I can't live off of that."
msg03:03:sno:C'mon, pay a little more.<BR>Be a friend.
//"Come on, buy it for a bit more than that."
msg03:03:sno:Is it... really worth so<BR>little?...
//"Eh? Is it worth that little?"
msg03:00:sno:Hmm... you can't give me<BR>just a little more?
//"Hmm... Could you give me a little bit more?"

msg04:03:sno:You can't sell it for a<BR>bit less?
//"I'd like you to sell it for a bit less than that."
msg04:03:sno:It's that much? Really?
//"Is it that expensive?"
msg04:00:sno:Sweet heaven, that's too<BR>expensive! Please make it<BR>cheaper!
//"Too expensive! Please, make it a bit cheaper."
msg04:03:sno:I can't afford that...<BR>can't you make it cheaper?
//"That's too much. Can't you make it a bit cheaper?"
msg04:03:sno:It's that much? You can't<BR>bring it down at all?
//"Is it that expensive? Can't you make it a bit cheaper?"
msg04:03:sno:I can't buy it at that<BR>price...
//"I can't buy it at that price."
msg04:03:sno:Could you take it down<BR>just a little bit?
//"Can't you make it a bit cheaper?"
msg04:03:sno:What the... it's that much?<BR>Are you serious?
//"Eh? Is it that expensive?"
msg04:00:sno:Hmm... can't you give me<BR>a slightly better deal?
//"Hmm... Can you make it a bit cheaper?"

msg05:01:sno:All right, I'll take that<BR>price.
//"All rigt. That's a good price."
msg05:04:sno:Hah! Your haggling skills<BR>win, miss! I'll take it.
//"Thank you. Sorry to ask for the impossible."
msg05:01:sno:Ah, I can't ask you to<BR>go any lower. Right, I'll<BR>take it.
//"Well, I suppose there's nothing for it. All right, that price will do."
msg05:04:sno:Yeah, that'll do.
//"Yeah, that price will do."
msg05:00:sno:Okay, that seems fair.
//"Okay, I can agree to that price."
msg05:01:sno:That's a pretty good<BR>deal, to be honest.
//"Actually, that's a pretty good price."
msg05:01:sno:Ah, I can't ask you to<BR>go any lower. Right, I'll<BR>take it.
//"All right, that's a fine price. It doesn't look like I can ask for anything else."
msg05:00:sno:Well, that seems about<BR>right. Okay, here's the<BR>money.
//"...well, that seems about right, I guess?"

msg06:03:sno:Sorry, I can't pay that<BR>at all.
//"There's no way I can pay that."
msg06:03:sno:Alright, I'm heading home.
//"...Okay, I'm going home for today."
msg06:03:sno:I had no idea it'd be that<BR>much... time to go home, I<BR>guess.
//"I had no idea it'd be that price."
msg06:03:sno:Well... I'll stop by again,<BR>maybe.
//"Sigh... I'll come by again."
msg06:03:sno:Ah, this isn't even worth<BR>talking about.
//"That's not even worth talking about."
msg06:03:sno:This isn't going anywhere...
//"This isn't going anywhere."
msg06:03:sno:Are you serious? Oi...
//"Are you serious?"
msg06:03:sno:Right, let's forget this<BR>ever happened. I'll stop<BR>by again sometime.
//"Okay, let's just pretend this never happened."

msg07:03:sno:I'll be back some time,<BR>I guess.
//"Right, I'll come again."
msg07:03:sno:Time to go to a<BR>different store, I guess.
//"I guess I'll go to a different store."
msg07:03:sno:Sorry, I can't sell at<BR>that price.
//"I don't really feel like selling at that price."
msg07:03:sno:This is going nowhere.
//"This isn't going anywhere."
msg07:03:sno:Right, let's forget this<BR>ever happened. I'll stop<BR>by again sometime.
//"Okay, let's just pretend this never happened."

msg08:03:sno:That's not what I<BR>wanted...
//"That's not what I wanted."
msg08:00:sno:No, don't need that...
//"I don't need that."
msg08:00:sno:I don't need anything<BR>like that.
//"I don't need anything like that."
msg08:03:sno:This isn't it at all...<BR>Heaven, why does this<BR>have to be so hard?
//"That isn't it at all... man, why does this have to be so hard?"
msg08:03:sno:I don't think you<BR>understood what I wanted...
//"Doesn't look like what I wanted got through to you."
msg08:03:sno:If you don't have it, you<BR>can just say so, you know...
//"If you don't have it, you could just say so."

msg09:00:sno:I see... well, all right.
//"I see... All right."
msg09:03:sno:Don't have it, huh...<BR>blast...
//"Don't have any, huh..."
msg09:03:sno:Well, if you don't have it,<BR>you don't have it.
//"Well, if you don't have any, not much you can do."

msg10:00:sno:I can't buy at that price.
//"I can't buy at that price."
msg10:03:sno:Okay, no matter how you<BR>slice it, that's<BR>unreasonable.
//"Okay, that price is unreasonable anyway you look at it."

msg11:00:sno:I can't sell at that price.
//"No way am I selling at that price."
msg11:03:sno:Okay, no matter how you<BR>slice it, that's<BR>unreasonable.
//"Okay, that price is unreasonable anyway you look at it."

msg12:00:sno:I'd like to buy<BR><S>...
//I'd like to buy an <S>..."
msg12:00:sno:The wife asked me to get<BR><S>.
//"I was told to go get an <S>."
msg12:00:sno:Hey, got<BR><S>?
//"Got any <S>?"
msg12:04:sno:The wife's been up in my<BR>shorts about getting<BR><S>.
//"My wife's been pestering me to get an <S>."
msg12:00:sno:You don't have<BR><S>,<BR>do you?
//"So I don't suppose you have an <S>, do you?"
msg12:00:sno:I'd like<BR><S>.
//"I'd like an <S>."
msg12:01:sno:I'm present-shopping, and<BR>I could really use<BR><S>.
//"I'm looking for an <S> for a present."

msg13:01:sno:Yeah, that price'll do.
//"All right. That price'll do."
msg13:04:sno:Man, even stuff like<BR>this sells!
//"Wow, even stuff like this sells."
msg13:00:sno:Alright. It may not be<BR>much, but here.
//"All right. It may not be much, but here."
msg13:04:sno:I'll take that price!
//"Right, I'll sell at that price."
msg13:04:sno:That's a great deal!
//"That price is fine."
msg13:00:sno:Yeah, that seems about<BR>fair. Here you go.
//"Hmm...Well, all right, that seems about right."
msg13:00:sno:Yeah, that seems<BR>appropriate.
//"That seems like a pretty appropriate amount of money."

msg15:00:sno:Hey, miss, I need<BR><D1> <S>.<C>If I return<BR><DA>,<BR>will you have them ready?
//"So, I want <D1> <S>. If I come by to buy them <DA> days from now, will you have them ready?"

msg16:01:sno:I'm the guy who ordered<BR><S>...
//"Do you have the <S> I asked for?"
msg16:01:sno:Hey, do you have my<BR><S>?
//"Hey, did you get those <S> I asked for in?"
msg16:00:sno:I've come to get my<BR><S>.
//"I've come to get the <S> I asked for."

msg17:03:sno:Well, alright. Never mind,<BR>then.

msg18:03:sno:I came by to get my<BR>order, but you weren't<BR>here...

msg19:03:sno:Ah, blast, I don't have<BR>the money on me.
//"Sorry... I don't have the money on me."
msg19:03:sno:Do I look like I have that<BR>kind of fortune?
//"I don't have that kind of fortune."
