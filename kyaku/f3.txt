msg08:03:sno:You just don't seem to<BR>understand...

msg09:00:sno:I see. Well, no sense in<BR>crying about it.
//"I see. Well, no point crying about it."
msg09:00:sno:Well, if you don't have<BR>it, there's nothing to be<BR>done.
//"If you don't have any, there's nothing to do."
msg09:00:sno:Sorry to bother you,<BR>then.
//"Sorry to bother you, then."
msg09:00:sno:Well, if you don't have<BR>it, there's nothing to be<BR>done.

msg09:01:sno:Well, it happens. Don't<BR>worry too much, okay?

msg09:00:sno:Well, nothing to be done<BR>for it then.

msg10:03:sno:This really isn't getting<BR>us anywhere.

msg10:03:sno:Sorry, but I'm not going<BR>any further with this.

msg10:00:sno:I wonder if a bigger<BR>shop might be better?

msg10:00:sno:Well, coming here was a<BR>mistake, I guess...

msg11:00:sno:Hmph, I'll find a better<BR>store.

msg11:03:sno:Well, trying to get<BR>anything from you seems<BR>pointless. Too bad...
